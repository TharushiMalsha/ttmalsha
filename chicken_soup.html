   <img src="Chicken Soup.jpg">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken (about 4 pounds), giblets removed</li>
        <li>10 cups water</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 carrots, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>3 celery stalks, sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups egg noodles or your preferred pasta</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

     <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the Chicken:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rinse the whole chicken under cold water and place it in a large soup pot.</li>
        <li>Add 10 cups of water to the pot, ensuring the chicken is fully submerged.</li>
        <li>Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Skim the Surface:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>As the water starts boiling, you may notice foam rising to the surface. Skim off this foam using a ladle or spoon. This helps to achieve a clearer broth.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Add Vegetables and Seasonings:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Add diced onion, sliced carrots, sliced celery, minced garlic, bay leaf, dried thyme, salt, and pepper to the pot.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the chicken is cooked through and the flavors have melded.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Remove Chicken and Shred:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Carefully remove the whole chicken from the pot and place it on a cutting board.</li>
        <li>Once it's cool enough to handle, shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces using forks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cook Noodles:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>While shredding the chicken, bring the soup back to a simmer and add the egg noodles or your preferred pasta. Cook according to the package instructions until the noodles are tender.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Return Shredded Chicken:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Add the shredded chicken back into the pot. Adjust the seasoning to taste, adding more salt and pepper if needed.</li>
    </ul>
