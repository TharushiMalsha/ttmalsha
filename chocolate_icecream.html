        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup chocolate chips (semi-sweet or milk chocolate)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>cooking Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Prepare Ice Cream Base:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, whole milk, granulated sugar, and vanilla extract until the sugar is dissolved. You now have the ice cream base.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Chill the Mixture:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the mixture for at least 4 hours or overnight. This chilling process helps develop the flavor and texture of the ice cream.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Churn in Ice Cream Maker:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Once the mixture is thoroughly chilled, pour it into your ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's instructions. This usually takes about 20-25 minutes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Add Chocolate Chips:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In the last few minutes of churning, add the chocolate chips to the ice cream maker. Let it mix until the chocolate chips are evenly distributed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Transfer to Container:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Transfer the churned ice cream to a lidded container.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Freeze:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Freeze the ice cream for at least 4 hours or until firm. This allows the ice cream to set properly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Serve and Enjoy:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Once the chocolate chip ice cream is fully frozen, scoop it into bowls or cones and enjoy! You can also drizzle with chocolate syrup or sprinkle additional chocolate chips on top for extra indulgence.</li>
